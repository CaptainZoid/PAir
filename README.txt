Notes for me:
-These flights are not real time
-They do not need to be changed or cancled 
-And no passengers missing trips
Objects:
	1. Customer:
		-6 digit identifier -> int
		-frequent-flyer -> bool (once achieved never lost) basically loyalty stuff
		-miles: qaulifing miles -> int (sum of all flight segments multipied by their unique multiper)
		-all_flight_costs-> touple (tital cost of all flight segments)
	2. Airport:
		-id: three character identifier for each airport
		-map_location: the cordinates for this very speicific airport
